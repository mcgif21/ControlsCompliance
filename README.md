<h1>Controls and Compliance Checklist</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Using the file titled "Botium Toys_Scope, goals, and risk assessment" I am  able to create a "Controls and Compliance Checklist" within the namesake pdf file. The checklist consists of Compliance and Regulations that are specific to the standards of a fictional company but which, I am sure, are common in the industry. I have also given actionable recommendations at the end of the checklist.
